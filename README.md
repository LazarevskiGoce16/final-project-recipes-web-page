## *My final project for the SEMOS Full-Stack JavaScript Academy* 
### For this project, I utilized the latest technologies and updates up to the year 2022 from the domains of the React JS framework, HTML, and vanilla CSS within the Front-end, or client-side, of the website. On the other hand, for the Back-end, which pertains to the server-side of the website, I used Node JS and MongoDB as an open-source NoSQL database.
